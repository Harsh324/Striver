** Preorder Traversal of Binary Tree

    ** Order is (Root, Left, Right)

    ** Implementation

        void Preorder(Node* Tree)
        {
            if(NULL == Tree)
                return;

            cout << Tree->data <<" ";
            Preorder(Tree->left);
            Preorder(Tree->right);
        }

        Time Complextiy : O(N) , N is number of Nodes in the Binary Tree
        Auxillary pace : O(N) , N is number of Nodes in the Binary Tree
