** Inorder Traversal of Binary Tree

    ** order is (Left, Root, Right)

    ** Implementation

        void Inorder(Node* Tree)
        {
            if(NULL == Tree)
                return;
            
            Inorder(Tree->left);
            cout << Tree->data <<" ";
            Inorder(Tree->right);
        }


        Time Complextiy : O(N) , N is number of Nodes in the Binary Tree
        Auxillary pace : O(N) , N is number of Nodes in the Binary Tree
