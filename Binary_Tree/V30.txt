## Children Sum Property in Binary Tree

    ** The children sum property is defined as, For every node of the tree, the value of a node is equal
       to the sum of values of its children(left child and right child).

    ** The node values can be increased by 1 any number of times but decrement of any node value is not
       allowed.

    ** A value for a NULL node can be assumed as 0.

    ** You are not allowed to change the structure of the given binary tree.


    void reorder(node * root) 
    {
        if (root == NULL) return;
        int child = 0;
        if (root -> left) {
            child += root -> left -> data;
        }
        if (root -> right) {
            child += root -> right -> data;
        }

        if (child < root -> data) {
            if (root -> left) root -> left -> data = root -> data;
            else if (root -> right) root -> right -> data = root -> data;
        }
    }
