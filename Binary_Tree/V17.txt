** Diameter of Binary Tree

    ** Diameter is the longest path between any two nodes.
    ** Path does not need to pass via root.

    ** Implementation

        int Height(Node* Tree, int* diameter)
        {
            if(NULL == Tree)
                return 0;

            int Left = Height(Tree->left);
            int Right = Height(Tree->right);
            diameter = max(diameter, Left + Right);

            return 1 + max(Left, Right);
        }

        int Diameter(Node* Tree)
        {
            int diameter = 0;
            Height(Tree, diameter);
            return diameter;
        }

        Time Complextiy : O(N), Where N is number of nodes in the Binary Tree
        Auxillary space : O(N), Where N is number of nodes in the Binary Tree
