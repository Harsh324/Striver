##  Requirements needed to construct a Unique Binary Tree


    ** If Given an preorder and postorder traversal, we cannot create an unique binary tree.
    ** Yet we can create a bianry tree but it may or may not be unique.
    ** It is very very important to get to konw what is on the left and what is on the right of the root
        to generate the unique binary tree, thus Inorder traversal is neccasory to get unique Binary tree
        along wiht one other traversal
