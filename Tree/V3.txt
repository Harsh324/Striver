** Binary tree representation 

    ** Typical Node of a bianry tree is Represented by Left,
        Right pointer and a data value;

    ** Implemenation

        struct Node
        {
            int data;
            struct Node* left;
            struct Node* right;

            Node(int Val)
            {
                data = Val;
                left = NULL;
                right = NULL;
            }
        };
